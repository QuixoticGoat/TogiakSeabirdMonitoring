The abundance and reproductive success of black-legged kittiwakes, common murres, and pelagic cormorants was monitored annually at Cape Peirce from 1990-2014 and 2016-2017. The goal of this work is to quantify temporal trends in abundance and identify environmental factors associated with changes in abundance.
