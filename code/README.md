The abundance and reproductive success of black-legged kittiwakes, common murres, and pelagic cormorants was monitored annually at Cape Peirce from 1990-2014 and 2016-2017. The goal of this work is to quantify temporal trends in abundance and identify environmental factors associated with changes in abundance.

**Contents**

*./code/1_ImportFormat.R*  
Imports a .csv file containg counts of seabirds and next by plot annually. Reformats data for plotting and analysis. Outputs the formatted data as a .RData file.  

*./code/2_Plots.R*
Creates summary plots of the data, including a lineplots and boxplots of annual seabird and nest abundance. 

*./code/3_Models.R*  
Generalized mixed effects models for quantifying the response of seabird and nest abundance to time (Year) and environmental variables.
